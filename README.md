### Description 

We created MIAMI-AD, a comprehensive knowledge base containing manually curated summary statistics from 97 published tables in 37 studies, all of which included at least 100 participants. MIAMI-AD enables easy browsing, querying, and downloading DNAm associations at multiple levels – at individual CpG, gene, genomic regions, or genome-wide, in one or multiple studies. Moreover, it also offers tools to perform integrative analyses, such as comparing DNAm associations across different phenotypes or tissues, as well as interactive visualizations. This open-access resource is freely available to the research community, and all the underlying data can be downloaded. MIAMI-AD (https://miami-ad.org/) facilitates integrative explorations to better understand the interplay between DNAm across aging, sex, and AD.

This repository includes scripts used for the MIAMI.AD database, located at [https://miami-ad.org](https://miami-ad.org/) The SQLite database file is too large (3.2 GB) to upload to GitHub, it's hosted on [Box](https://miami.box.com/s/qye8oj8m8n127oc5qamgdvwmalsamun0). It needs to be placed in the `inst/shiny/Data/SQL_DBs` directory.
