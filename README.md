# MIAMI.AD
A repository of the code for the MIAMI.AD shiny server, to be located at [https://miami-ad.org](https://miami-ad.org/)

The SQLite database file is too large (3.2 GB) to upload to GitHub, it's hosted on [Box](https://miami.box.com/s/qye8oj8m8n127oc5qamgdvwmalsamun0). It needs to be placed in the `inst/shiny/Data/SQL_DBs` directory.
